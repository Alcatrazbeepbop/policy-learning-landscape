# Interpolation Experiments

This set of scripts and code is used to conduct interpolation experiments and
paired random direction experiments. A short description of each file is given:

## Utilities

-   `common_flags.py`: Flags that are common to all experiments.
-   `landscape_explorers.py`: Code to explore optimization landscapes.
-   `multiprocessing_tools.py`: Flags that are common to all experiments.
-   `common_flags.py`: Flags that are common to all experiments.

## Experiments

-   `paired_random_directions_experiment.py`: Experiments to discover the local
    landscape of the objective function.
-   `simple_1d_interpolation_experiment.py`: Experiments to interpolate between
    parameters and visualize the objective function.
